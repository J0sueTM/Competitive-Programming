# Fibonacci Sequence

A sequence of number is called "Fibonacci Sequence" if taken three consecutive numbers, a, b, c, the following happens:

```
c - b = a
```

### Every F.S. must have
- **Initial terms** are the three numbers that begins the sequence: 0 1 1. However, any two numbers can initialize a F.S
- **Difference** is the difference between any two consecutive number. As already said, this difference must be the number two positions before, except for the two first terms

**Example**

$$0 --> 1 --> 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 5 --> 8.$$
