### Every F.S. must have
- **Initial terms** are the two numbers that begins the sequence: 0 1. However, any two numbers can initialize a F.S, if they follow the fibonacci rule
- **Difference** is the difference between any two consecutive number. As already said, this difference must be the number two positions before, except for the two first terms

**Example**

0 --> 1 --> 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 5 --> 8
