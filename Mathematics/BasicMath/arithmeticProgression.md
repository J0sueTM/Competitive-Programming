# Arithmetic Progression

A sequence of numbers is called "Arithmetic Progression" if the difference between any two consecutive terms is always the same.

* * *

### Every A.P. must have

**Initial Term** is the first number in the sequence
**Common difference** is the value by which consecutive terms increase or decrease:
    * positive, then the terms will grow towards positive infinity
    * negative, then the terms will grow towards negative infinity

Example:

$$1 --> 4 --> --> 7 --> 10.$$

```
initial term = 1
common difference = 3
positive
```

### Formulas

**N<sup>th</sup> term of an A.P**

```
a = sequence
n = position of the nth number
d = common difference
```

$$a_{n} = a_{1} + (n - 1)\times d.$$

**Sum of first N<sup>th</sup> terms of an A.P.**

```
S = sum
n = position of the nth number
d = common difference
```

$$S_{n} = \frac{n}{2}\times [2\times a + (n - 1)\times d].$$
