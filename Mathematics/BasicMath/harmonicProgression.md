# Harmonic Progression

A sequence of numbers is called a Harmonic Progression if the reciprocal of the every two consecutive terms are the always the same. Harmonic Progresssions' terms' reciprocals are generally made out of arithmetic progressions.

### Every H.P must have

- **Initial term** is the first number of the sequence
- **Common difference(between the reciprocals)** is the difference between the reciprocals of every two consecutive terms

**Example**

```
initial term = 1/5
reciprocal common difference = 5
positive
```

## Formula

**Nth term of an H.P**

```
a = sequence
n = position of the nth term
d = reciprocal common difference
```
