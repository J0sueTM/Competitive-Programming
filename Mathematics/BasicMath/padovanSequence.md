A sequence of numbers is called "Padovan Sequence" if taken four consecutive numbers, a, b, c, d, the following happens:

### Every P.S. must have
- **Initial terms** are the three numbers that begin the sequence: 1, 1, 1. However, any three numbers can initialize a P.S, if they follow the padovan rule
- **Difference** is the difference, given a, b, c, and d, between d and b that must be equal to a, except for the first three terms

**Example**

1 --> 1 --> 1 --> 2 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 7 --> 9
