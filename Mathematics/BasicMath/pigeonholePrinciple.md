# Pigeonhole Priciple

The pigeonhole priciple has the following theorems:

- If "A" is the average number of pigeons per hole, then:
    * At lest one pigeon hole contains the smallest integer greater than or equal to A (ceil[A])
    * Remaining pigeon holes contains at most the largest integer less tahn or wqual to A (floor[A])

- Let X and Y be finite sets and let ![](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a58c27f9db7fb77d5f0f60d409c11750_l3.svg) be a function

    * If X has more elements than Y, then f is not one to one
    * If X and Y have the same number of elements and f is onto, then f is ont to one
    * If X and Y have the same number of elements and f is one to one, then f is onto

**Example**

If (Kn + 1) pigeons are kept in n pigeon holes where K is a positive integer, the average number of pigeons per pigeon hole is:

Therefore there will be at least two pigeons at the same pigeon hole
