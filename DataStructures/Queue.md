# Queue

A queue is a linear data structure - operates in O(n) - similar to the stack, differing by the fact that it works by FIFO (first in first out), instead of FILO (first in last out). In a more counter-intuitive abstraction, you can think on queues as a shop, where the first client to enter is attended first, while the last client will be attended last.
These are the operations that a queue should proportionate:

- **Rear** gets the last added item from the queue.
- **Front**  gets the item on the front of the queue.
- **Enqueue** adds a new item to the queue.
- **Dequeue** removes the 
- **isEmpty** gets whether the queue is empty or not.
- **isFull** In case the queue has a defined size, gets wheter the queue is  full or not.

These are the variations of the queue DS, including the basic itself:

- Queue
- Priority Queue
- Circular Queue
- Deque

# Implementation

Each one are generally implemented with array or linked list. But, you can also use stacks.

### Array

**Queue**

**Priority Queue**

**Circular Queue**

**Deque**

### Linked List

**Queue**

**Priority Queue**

**Deque**

### Stack

**Queue**
