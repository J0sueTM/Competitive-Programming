# Competitive-Programming

Hi, this repository is being made by me, J0sueTM while I'm learning competitive programming concepts

I'm currently using these sites, books and blogs:

[Geeks-for-geeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org)

[Competitive Programmer's handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)

[My-personal-trello-for-CP](https://trello.com/b/a7m8UZsw/cp)
